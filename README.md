# LeetCode Solutions with Traceable Code and Test Cases --> Come see how it works! üîçüíª

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems, with a strong emphasis on code clarity, thorough testing, and in-depth understanding.

## What You'll Find Here

* **Clean and Well-Commented Code:** Each solution is written with readability in mind, making it easy to follow the logic.
* **Traceable Code:** I strive to write code that can be easily traced using tools like Python Tutor, allowing you to visualize the execution flow and understand the algorithm step-by-step.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Every solution includes a set of test cases to ensure its correctness and robustness.
* **Detailed Explanations:** I provide explanations for each solution, breaking down the problem, the chosen approach, and the time/space complexity analysis.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Browse the Problems:** Navigate through the repository to find the LeetCode problem you're interested in.
2.  **Explore the Solution:** Open the corresponding file to view the code, test cases, and explanations.
3.  **Trace the Code:** Copy the code into a tool like Python Tutor to visualize its execution.
4.  **Run the Test Cases:** Execute the test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.
5.  **Learn and Improve:** Use the explanations and traceable code to deepen your understanding of the algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

Each problem is organized into its own directory, named according to the LeetCode problem number and title. For example:


‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Problem-Statement/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solution
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_cases
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

* `solution`: Contains the solution to the problem.
* `test_cases`: Includes the test cases for the solution.
* `README.md`: Provides a detailed explanation of the problem and the solution.
